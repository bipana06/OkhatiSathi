Drug,Comments
Abacavir,"Antiretroviral drugs may be present in breast milk, and may reduce viral load in breast milk and reduce the risk of transmission through breast-feeding. However, the concentration of antiretroviral drugs in breast milk may not be adequate to prevent viral replication and there is therefore possibility of promoting the development of drug-resistant virus which could be transmitted to the infant. Avoid breast- feeding if possible. Otherwise, exclusive breast-feeding is recommended during the first months of life, then should be discontinued as soon as feasible"
