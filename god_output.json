However, this might only be of importance\nin cases of poisoning with a poison that have a specific antidote. Treatment\nis usually symptomatic and only a few patients require active removal of\nthe drug. However, knowledge of type and timing of poisoning may help\nanticipate the course of events and hence may direct therapy.\nAll relevant information should be retrieved from the patients and their\nguardians, however, these should not be fully relied upon. Patients’ reports\nare generally of little help for they are usually confused and those from\nparents may also be exaggerative due to anxiety or guilt. So, patient should\nbe assessed carefully and interpretation should be made reasonably.\nRisk assessment is pivotal in developing a management plan tailored to\nthe individual patient, however, is secondary only to resuscitation in the\nmanagement of acute poisoning.\n13.2 Clues to poisoning\nPupils:\n•\tFixed dilated pupils: may be a sign of death, but it could also be due to\natropine, tricyclic antidepressants, antihistamines, etc. Therefore, even in\nthe presence of acute respiratory or cardiac arrest, resuscitation should be\nattempted.\n•\tPinpoint pupils: may be a sign of pontine hemorrhage, but consider opioid\npoisoning, mushroom, organophosphorus insecticide or other cholinergic\npoisoning.\nRespiration: Often impaired in unconscious patients.\nBlood pressure: Hypotension is common in severe poisoning with CNS\ndepressants. Hypertension occurs less frequently than hypotension and\nmight be associated with sympathomimetics or CNS stimulating agents.\nHeart: Cardiac conduction defects and arrhythmias may occur with acute\npoisonings with drugs like tricyclic antidepressants, some antipsychotics,\nsome antihistaminics, etc.\nConvulsions: A dazed look and oculogyric spasms. Think of phenothiazine\noverdose (iatrogenic).\nBody temperature : Hypothermia may develop in unconscious patients\nespecially with overdose of barbiturates or phenothiazines.  Hyperthermia\noccurs with CNS stimulants.\nPatient looks drunk: may be hypoglycemic, but consider all hypnotics,\nsedatives and antipsychotics.\nMetabolic acidosis: may be diabetic or due to severe gastro-enteritis, but do\nnot forget salicylate poisoning.\nNNF 2018\n323\n13.3 Risk assessment based approach to poisoning\n•\tResuscitation (ABCDE)\n•\tAirway\n•\tBreathing\n•\tCirculation\n•\tDetect and correct\n▪▪Hypoglycemia\n◦◦Check for blood glucose level in patients with altered mental status\n◦◦Treat if level <4.0 mmol/L: 50 ml 50% dextrose IV.\n▪▪Seizures\n◦◦Usually generalized\n▫▫IV benzodiazepines are first-line\n▫▫Barbiturates are second-line therapy\n▫▫Pyridoxine in case of seizures secondary to isoniazid\n▪▪Hyper/hypothermia\n•\tEmergency antidote administration\n•\tRisk assessment\n•\tAgent\n•\tDose\n•\tTime since ingestion\n•\tClinical features and course\n•\tPatient factors\n▪▪Weight\n▪▪Co-morbidities\n•\tSupportive care and monitoring\n•\tInitial period of close observation and monitoring in emergency\n•\tMaintain ABC; correct metabolic, fluid and electrolyte imbalances\n•\tInvestigations\n•\tScreening-12-lead ECG\n•\tDrug levels in body fluids\n•\tOther selective investigations that will assist risk assessment or\nmanagement\n•\tDecontamination and enhanced elimination\n•\tAntidotes\n•\tDisposition\n13.4 Decontamination/Prevention of absorption and active elimination\nof drugs\n13.4.1 Skin decontamination",

Avoid sitting near a window as UVA can pass through glass. In sunny\nconditions use a sun block/high SPF sunscreen, SPF25 or greater, on all light\nexposed areas of the skin following your treatment.\nIf your face is unaffected by your skin condition and/or your face is protected\nduring treatment then apply a sun block / high SPF sunscreen after taking\nthe Psoralen tablets.
